                    <p>We know "growth hacker" is the new buzzword, but it actually does describe what we're looking for. As a growth hacker and data analyst, you naturally love data and you love how to find ways to improve the data.</p>

                    <p>For example, you might find out that a top-voted post on Product Hunt is much more valuable than any ad on facebook. Or that improving the on-boarding process by 5% is a much better strategy for growth than getting more eyes on our marketing website. Words like retention, conversions, Mixpanel, A/B testing, analytics are all familiar things to you.</p>

                    <p>In addition to that, you think creatively. You're great at finding the non-traditional ways to growth and get excited when we're able to increase numbers in the right direction.</p>
