                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>A:</strong>Recent incentives have made the installation of solar panels an even wiser investment.  A 30% federal tax credit (IRS Form 5695) has recently been extended and you may qualify for the California Solar Initiative (CSI) which is a solar rebate program for California.  <br>

                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>A:</strong>The size of solar system you need depends on several factors such as how much electricity or hot water or space heat you use, how, the size of your roof, and how much you're willing to invest. Also, do you want the system to supply your complete energy usage or to supplant a portion of your higher cost energy usage? You can contact a system designer/installer to determine what type of system would suit your needs.</p>

                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>Q:</strong>Why should I purchase a PV system?</p>
                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>A:</strong>People decide to buy solar energy systems for a variety of reasons. For example, some individuals buy solar products to preserve the Earth's finite fossil-fuel resources and to reduce air pollution. Others would rather spend their money on an energy-producing improvement to their property than send their money to a utility. Some people like the security of reducing the amount of electricity they buy from their utility, because it makes them less vulnerable to future increases in the price of electricity.

                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>Q:</strong>How much does a solar energy system cost, and how much will I save on utility bills?</p>
                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>A:</strong>Unfortunately, there is no single or simple answer. But a solar rebate and other incentives can reduce the cost of a PV system. This cost depends on a number of factors, such as whether it is a stand-alone system or is integrated into the building design, the size of the system, and the particular system manufacturer, retailer, and installer. In most cases, you would have to add the cost of natural gas or electricity to get a more accurate estimate of how much you can expect to pay for a solar energy system. It is also difficult to say how much you will save with a solar energy system, because savings depend on how much you pay your utility for electricity, and how much your utility will pay you for any excess power that you generate with your solar system. You can ask your solar system provider how much your new system will produce on an annual basis and compare that number to your annual electricity to get an idea of how much you will save.</p>

                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>A:</strong>You should certainly consider custom-sized windows for the very simple reason that they'll fit better. Stock-sized windows can require extensive carpentry work both inside and outside your home. Such work can be costly and inconvenient.</p>

We are proud to say that Anlin windows not only meet Energy Star requirements, they exceed the Energy Star requirement by as much as 45%.</p>

                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>Q:</strong>What should I look for when comparing window warranties?</p>
                            <p class="post__introduction"><strong>A:</strong>There is a wide range of differences in window manufacturer’s warranties. For example some brand name factory warranties cover parts but not labor. Some cover labor, but up to limited amounts and for limited time periods. Some warranties cover accidental glass breakage and some don’t. And different warranties provide different provisions for transferring the warranty when you sell your home. To learn what your warranty really covers, be sure to read the actual warranty rather than relying on a sales brochure.</p>
